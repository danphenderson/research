    \section{Introduction}
        \label{sec:introduction}
        \medskip

        The circulatory system consits of a human's humans heart,
        vascular network, lungs and organs. The heart is the source,
        transporting Oxygen-rich blood to the organs and
        deoxygenated (and carbon dioxide enriched) blood back to the lungs;
        to discharge $CO2$ and enrich blood with Oxygen. We refer to these
        respective processes as the \emph{pulmonary circulation} and
        the \emph{systemic circulation} (resp.). The \emph{macrocirculatory
        system}, consists of the heart and the large vessels in the systemic circulation.
        Particularly, the arteries and large vessels of the macrocirculatory system transport
        oxygenated blood from the heart, driving the return of deoxygenated blood back to the heart.
        Hemodynamics refers to the study of blood flow in the circulatory system.

        \medskip

        Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in developed nations.
        According to the World Health Organization (WHO), CVD accounts for approximately
        31\% of all global deaths, making it a significant public health concern.
        Understanding the hemodynamics of the macrocirculatory system is crucial for
        diagnosing, treating, and preventing CVD. We aim to develop mathematical models
        that accurately describe blood flow in the macrocirculatory system. Our motivation
        is to use these models to simulate and analyze various cardiovascular conditions,
        such as arterial stenosis, aneurysms, and heart valve disorders.

        \medskip

        A single beat of the heart propels blood through the macrocirculatory system,
        and the cardiac cycle refers to the events between two successive heartbeats.
        The cardiac cycle consists of two main phases: systole and diastole, during which
        the heart chamber is accumulating blood and releasing blood (resp.).
        The beat can be recognized as a pulse wave in large vessels.

        \medskip

        We assume a normal resting heart rate of approximately 70 beats per minute (bpm),
        which corresponds to a cardiac cycle duration of approximately 0.86 seconds.
        We refer to a single beat of the heart, and the following relaxation period,
        as the cardiac cycle. The cardiac cycle consists of two main phases:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Systole  duration $\approx 0.15-0.3$ seconds. Heart contracts,
            propelling blood into the arteries. The "lub-dub" sound derives from
            the start and end of systole, when the heart valves close.
            \item Diastole duration $\approx 0.7$ seconds. Heart relaxes,
            allowing the chambers to fill with blood.
        \end{itemize}
        The blood volume of human is approximately 5.7-6.0 liters of blood,
        flowing a full cycle approximately every 70 beats. The energy driving
        the flow comes from oxygen and nutrients absorbed from food, creating waste
        products that must be removed; the \emph{coronary artery}'s responsibility.
        The buildup of waste products results in Arteriosclerosis, a narrowing of
        the artery.

        \medskip

        Our concern is the flow of blood in the
        macrocirculatory system. We develop mathematical
        models descibing the hemodynamics of arterial and
        large venous segments, refered to as \emph{compliant vessels},
        then we extend our models to macrocirculation networks.

        \subsection{The Navier Stokes System}
            \label{subsec:intro-navier-stokes}

            In \textit{continuum mechanics}, matter is modeled by
            \textit{continuous fields}. For instance, to model the
            behavior of an \textit{incompressible} fluid in time,
            one could use a \textbf{pressure field} and a \textbf{velocity field}.
            At \textit{atomic scales}, this model breaks down—fluids
            as fluids are discrete collections of molecules, not continuous
            fields. However, at the macroscopic scale, one can hope that
            such models remain accurate.

    % ------------------ SECTION: Coronary Artery Stenosis (CAS)
    % -----------------------------------------------------------------
    \section{Coronary Artery Stenosis (CAS)}
        \label{sec:cas}

        Coronary artery stenosis (CAS) is the narrowing of the
        coronary arteries due to the buildup of plaque. This
        narrowing can restrict blood flow to the heart muscle,
        leading to various cardiovascular problems, including
        chest pain (angina), heart attacks, and other serious
        complications. Current methods for predicting coronary
        artery stenosis are rudimentary; and often prediction
        does mean coronary artery stenosis obstruction (\cite{ehab332}).
        . There is a need for more accurate and reliable methods
        to predict and assess the severity of CAS.

        We perform a literature survey of arterial blood flow using known
        methods from the literature, with the hope of understanding the
        computational challenges and tradeoffs of various \emph{mathematical models}.

        \todo{
            Make some comment about "correct terminology for describing the
            types of coronary arterial stenosis is "coronary artery stenosis morphology." and ref
            figures in DOI: 10.1056
        }

        \todo{
            Understand Dr. Zhou's statement: Regarding the assumption about the absence
            of a vortex, I cannot definitively say whether it is correct or not. Please review
            the references provided. If needed, we can discuss this further with interventional
            cardiologists.
