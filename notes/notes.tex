\section{Introduction}
    \label{sec:intro}

    \medskip

    Current methods for predicting coronary artery stenosis are
    rudimentary; and often prediction does mean coronary artery stenosis
    obstruction. (\hyperlink{https://watermark.silverchair.com/ehab332.pdf}{ref})

    \bigskip

    \td{Are we merely intrested in predicting an obstruction, or, are we interested
    in predicting the risk associated with the obstruction? TODO: continue to define research
    problem(s) of interest. }

    \bigskip

    We perform a literature survey of arterial blood flow using known
    methods from the literature, with the hope of understanding the
    computational challenges and tradeoffs of various \emph{mathematical models}.

    \bigskip

    The human cardiovascular system supplys the human organs
    with blood, also known as the circulatory system. We study various
    mathematical models describing the dynamics of the circularty
    system. The principal quantities of our models are the bloods velocity $\vct{u}$
    and pressure $\vct{p}$, and throughout it will be assumed that we are modeling a segment
    of the circulatory sytem restrict corresponding to an arterial region.
    Knowing the pressure and velocity for a portion of time allows us to compute stresses to
    which an arterial wall is subjected to due to the blood movement.

    Note, our arterial boundary $\partial \Omega$ is a surface in $\R^3$
    that evolves in time which we refer to as the interface.
    Note, an explicit representation of $\partial \Omega$ maps $(t, \theta, r, \theta, z)
    \mapsto (x, y, z)$. At times, it may be advantagoues to consider
    $\partial \Omega$ as an implicit interface, where the isocontors of our boundary
    represent the interface... \todo{This is a bit weird, look into the cylindrical coordinates
    implicit dynamical surface representations of our arterory}.

    The region enclosed our interface is $\Omega$, and we aim to model the
    velocity and pressure fields on $\Omega$; which also is evolving in time.


    \todo{
        Make some comment about "correct terminology for describing the
        types of coronary arterial stenosis is "coronary artery stenosis morphology." and ref
        figures in DOI: 10.1056
    }

    \todo{
        Understand Dr. Zhou's statement: Regarding the assumption about the absence
        of a vortex, I cannot definitively say whether it is correct or not. Please review
        the references provided. If needed, we can discuss this further with interventional
        cardiologists.

In \textit{continuum mechanics}, matter is modeled by \textit{continuous fields}.
For instance, to model the behavior of an \textit{incompressible} fluid in time, one could use a \textbf{pressure field}:

\[
p: \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}, \quad (t, x) \mapsto p(t, x)
\]

and a \textbf{velocity field}:

\[
\mathbf{u}: \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^3, \quad (t, x) \mapsto \mathbf{u}(t, x)
\]

\[
\mathbf{u}(t, x) = (u_1(t, x), u_2(t, x), u_3(t, x))
\]

At \textit{atomic scales}, this model breaks down—fluids are discrete collections of molecules, not continuous fields. However, one can hope that such models remain accurate at macroscopic scales.

\section{Preliminaries}
    \label{sec:preliminaries}
    \medskip
    % ------------------ Subsection: Navier-Stokes Equations


\subsection{The Navier-Stokes Equations}
    \label{sec:preliminaries}

    \medskip

The fundamental mathematical model for incompressible fluids (e.g., water) is the \textbf{viscous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations} (NS):

\[
\begin{cases}
    \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \mathbf{u} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u} = \nu \Delta \mathbf{u} - \nabla p, & \text{(Momentum equation: Newton's law } F = ma\text{)} \\
    \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0, & \text{(Incompressibility condition)} \\
    \mathbf{u}(0, x) = \mathbf{u}_0(x), & \text{(Initial conditions)}
\end{cases}
\]

where \( \nu > 0 \) is the \textit{viscosity} of the fluid (the limiting case \( \nu = 0 \) corresponds to the \textit{Euler equations}).

The initial velocity field is given by:

\[
\mathbf{u}_0 : \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^3, \quad \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}_0 = 0.
\]

\section*{Global Regularity Problem}

Given smooth, spatially localized initial data

\[
\mathbf{u}_0 : \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^3,
\]

do there exist smooth solutions

\[
\mathbf{u} : [0, +\infty) \times \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^3, \quad p : [0, +\infty) \times \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}
\]

to the Navier-Stokes equations?

\section*{Local Existence Theorem}

For any smooth, spatially localized initial data \( \mathbf{u}_0 \), there exists a \textbf{maximal time of existence} \( 0 < T_* \leq +\infty \) and a solution.

If \( T_* \neq +\infty \), then \textbf{blowup} occurs in the sense that

\[
\sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}^3} |\mathbf{u}(t, x)| \to +\infty \quad \text{as} \quad t \to T_*.
\]

If \( T_* = +\infty \), no blowup occurs, and \( |\mathbf{u}| \to 0 \) as \( t \to +\infty \).

\section*{Turbulence and Regularity}

Numerical simulations suggest that global regularity is generally \textbf{true}—for \textit{most} choices of initial data \( \mathbf{u}_0 \), one has a global smooth solution to (NS).

However, for large initial data, turbulence can occur. Energy moves from coarse to fine scales in a complex way before dissipating due to viscous effects.

\section*{Dimensional Analysis}

The Navier-Stokes equation consists of a balance between:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{transport term}: \( \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} \)
    \item The \textbf{dissipation term}: \( \nu \Delta \mathbf{u} \)
\end{itemize}

Heuristically, if \( \nu \Delta \mathbf{u} \gg (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u} \), one expects linear, non-turbulent behavior (\textit{global regularity}).

If \( (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u} \gg \nu \Delta \mathbf{u} \), one expects \textbf{nonlinear turbulence} (and possibly \textbf{blowup}).

\section*{Kinetic Energy Considerations}

The kinetic energy is given by:

\[
E(t) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} |\mathbf{u}(t, x)|^2 \, dx.
\]

This quantity is \textit{decreasing in time} due to dissipation. Heuristically:

\[
E(t) \gtrsim V^2 L^3.
\]

This leads to a bound:

\[
V = O(L^{-3/2}).
\]

\section*{Blowup Scenarios}

This suggests a \textbf{possible blowup scenario}. If the velocity field concentrates in a ball of radius \( L_1 \), we estimate:

\[
|\mathbf{u}| \approx L_1^{-3/2}.
\]

At a later time \( t_2 \), the energy has concentrated further into a ball of radius \( L_2 = L_1 / 2 \), so:

\[
|\mathbf{u}| \approx L_2^{-3/2}.
\]

This leads to \textbf{potential infinite velocity} at a single spatial point:

\[
\sum_{n} L_n^{r_2} < \infty.
\]

At each stage, the dissipative forces are negligible compared to the transport effects. This results in an approximately self-similar solution.

\textbf{Perfectly self-similar solutions are known to not exist for Navier-Stokes.}

\section*{Final Question}

\textbf{But can one actually \underline{construct} such an approximately self-similar solution?}

    \subsection{Review of Modeling Blood Flow in Human Circulatory System}
    \label{sec:article-1}



    We start by simulating a cut region, i.e., an arterial segment. We perform numerical simulations
    of various models to understand the following:
    \begin{center}
        Suppose there are $n$ stenotic regions within our arterial segment and $j$ regions are determined
        to be high risk. Standard protocol suggests to remove the $j$ regions regions; but in what order? Also,
        how are the blood flow dynamics effected at each step of cardiologists intervention. Additionally,
        consider the first step of intervention, which region should be focused on first? How does the removal
        of the first stenotic region effect the remaining $n - 1$ regions (it may release debry to only get blocked
        in a later region). What is the best by-pass configuration?
    \end{center}
