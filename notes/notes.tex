    \section{Physiological Introduction}
        \label{sec:introduction}
        \medskip

        The circulatory system consists of a human's heart,
        vascular network, lungs and organs. The heart is the source,
        transporting Oxygen-rich blood to the organs and
        deoxygenated (and carbon dioxide enriched) blood back to the lungs;
        which discharge $CO2$ and enrich blood with Oxygen. We refer to these
        respective processes as the \emph{pulmonary circulation} and
        the \emph{systemic circulation} (resp.). The \emph{macrocirculatory
        system}, consists of the heart and the large vessels in the systemic circulation.
        Particularly, the arteries of the macrocirculatory system transport
        oxygenated blood from the heart, driving the return of deoxygenated blood in
        large vessels back to the heart. Hemodynamics refers to the study of blood flow in
        the circulatory system.

        \medskip

        Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in developed nations.
        According to the World Health Organization (WHO), CVD accounts for approximately
        31\% of all global deaths, making it a significant public health concern.
        Understanding the hemodynamics of the macrocirculatory system is crucial for
        diagnosing, treating, and preventing CVD. We aim to develop mathematical models
        that accurately describe blood flow in the macrocirculatory system. Our motivation
        is to use these models to simulate and analyze various cardiovascular conditions,
        such as arterial stenosis, aneurysms, and heart valve disorders.

        \medskip

        A single beat of the heart propels blood through the macrocirculatory system,
        the "lub-dub" sound and the sequence of successive events until the next
        heartbeat is referred to as the \emph{cardiac cycle}. The cardiac cycle consists of
        two main phases: systole and diastole, during which the heart chamber is
        accumulating blood and releasing blood (resp.). The beat can be recognized as a pulse
        wave in large vessels, characterized by the Wormsley number $W_0$:
        \[ 
            W_0 := D \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\omega \rho}{\eta}},
        \]
        a dimensionless parameter comparing the frequency $\omega$
        of the pulse wave to the blood viscosity $\eta$ and the vessel diameter $D$.
        The Reynolds number $Re$ characterizes flow in blood vessels:
        \[
            Re := \frac{\rho U D}{\eta},
        \]
        where $U$ is the mean flow velocity. Low $Re$ indicates laminar flow,
        while high $Re$ suggests turbulent flow. Note \autocite[Table~1.1, p.~10, §1.1]{MathematicalEngineering}
        shows $W_0 \propto D$ and $Re \propto D^{-1}$; we
        observe large pulses and turbulent flow in large vessels and small pulses
        and laminar flow in small vessels.

        \medskip
        
        Assume a normal resting heart rate of $\omega = 70$ bpm,
        so the duration of a cardiac cycle is approximately $0.86 s.$:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Systole duration $\approx 0.15-0.3$ seconds. Heart contracts,
            propelling blood into the arteries. The "lub-dub" sound derives from
            the start and end of systole, where heart valves open and close.
            \item Diastole duration $\approx 0.7$ seconds. Heart relaxes,
            allowing the chambers to fill with blood.
        \end{itemize}
        The blood volume of human is approximately 5.7-6.0 liters of blood,
        flowing a full cycle approximately every 70 beats. The energy driving
        the flow comes from oxygen and nutrients absorbed from food, creating waste
        products that must be removed; the \emph{coronary artery}'s responsibility.
        The buildup of waste products results in Arteriosclerosis, a narrowing of
        the coronary artery, leading to reduced and turbulent blood flow. (Add citations
        here of turbulence in the presence of stenotic arteries)

    \section{Navier Stokes System}
        \label{subsec:intro-navier-stokes}

        Our concern is the flow of blood in the
        macrocirculatory system. We develop mathematical
        models describing the hemodynamics of arterial and
        large venous segments, then we extend our models to macrocirculation networks.

        In \textit{continuum mechanics}, matter is modeled by
        \textit{continuous fields}. For instance, to model the
        behavior of an \textit{incompressible} fluid in time,
        one could use a \textbf{pressure field} and a \textbf{velocity field}.
        At \textit{atomic scales}, this model breaks down—fluids
        as fluids are discrete collections of molecules, not continuous
        fields. However, at the macroscopic scale, one can hope that
        such models remain accurate.

    % ------------------ SECTION: Coronary Artery Stenosis (CAS)
    % -----------------------------------------------------------------
    \section{Coronary Artery Stenosis (CAS)}
        \label{sec:cas}

        Coronary artery stenosis (CAS) is the narrowing of the
        coronary arteries due to the buildup of plaque. This
        narrowing can restrict blood flow to the heart muscle,
        leading to various cardiovascular problems, including
        chest pain (angina), heart attacks, and other serious
        complications. Current methods for predicting coronary
        artery stenosis are rudimentary; and often prediction
        does mean coronary artery stenosis obstruction (\cite{ehab332}).
        . There is a need for more accurate and reliable methods
        to predict and assess the severity of CAS.

        \bigskip

        We perform a literature survey of arterial blood flow using known
        methods from the literature, with the hope of understanding the
        computational challenges and tradeoffs of various \emph{mathematical models}.

            Make some comment about "correct terminology for describing the
            types of coronary arterial stenosis is "coronary artery stenosis morphology." and ref

        }

        \todo{
            Understand Dr. Zhou's statement: Regarding the assumption about the absence
            of a vortex, I cannot definitively say whether it is correct or not. Please review
            the references provided. If needed, we can discuss this further with interventional
            cardiologists.
