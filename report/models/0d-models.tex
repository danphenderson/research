A simple reduction of the kinematic viscosity NS equations~\ref{def:kinematic-viscosity-ns}
is obtained by averaging pressure and velocity over a vessel's cross-sectional area.
This yields a lumped-parameter model, often called a 0D model, where pressure and
velocity are functions of time only. Herein~\ref{subsec:0dmodels}, we discuss
several 0D models, starting with the Windkessel model, a simple RC circuit analog
for blood flow in large vessels. Then, we discuss more complex 0D models that
include inertial effects and nonlinearities.
