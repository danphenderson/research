Machine learning techniques for learning solutions to initial-boundary
value problems were first proposed by Lagaris et al. \ref{Lagaris1998} in
1998. Since then, a variety of neural network architectures and training strategies
have been proposed for learning solutions to PDEs. In this section, we introduce
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) as introduced by Raissi et al. \ref{RaissiM2019},
one of the most widely used methods for learning strong solutions to PDEs. We then
present a workflow to learn arterial flows.
