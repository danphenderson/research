    \section{Introduction}
        \label{sec:intro}
        Hemodynamics studies the kinematics of blood. Our interest is the kinematic motion
        of blood within the human macrocirculatory system, i.e. the flow of blood in large
        vessels such as arteries and veins. Blood is observed as a complex fluid of formed 
        elements suspended in plasma, thus, the rheological behavior of blood is non-trivial.
        We report techniques and methodologies for modeling blood's motion in large vessels.

        \medskip 
        
        Our report is organized as follows. 
        
        \medskip

        We start our introduction by stating the report's motivation, then Sec.~\ref{subsec:physiology} 
        provides a brief physiological review of the human circulatory system. We follow with
        Sec.~\ref{subsec:continuum}, which reviews the continuum hypothesis, (a necessary postulate 
        in fluid mechanics), which treats blood as a continuous medium. This framing reduces 
        the hemodynamic problem to describing blood’s motion in a continuum. Then 
        Sec.~\ref{subsec:bloodmodel} discusses various rheological assumptions and 
        constitutive relations for modeling blood as an incompressible fluid. And finally,
        Sec.~\ref{subsec:ns} derives the kinematic-viscosity Navier–Stokes (NS) equations,
        a system of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) that herein serves as 
        the foundation of our modeling efforts. 

        \medskip

        \paragraph{Motivation}
        Coronary artery stenosis (CAS) is the narrowing of the coronary arteries due
        to the buildup of plaque. Such narrowing can restrict blood flow to the heart muscle,
        which may lead to various cardiovascular problems. Current methods for predicting a stenotic
        blockage (SB) in a coronary artery are rudimentary, and often SB predicition doesn't mean obstruction [\cite{ehab332}].
        Additionally, current clinical methods for assessing the severity of a SB rely on imaging techniques
        such as angiography, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), and optical coherence tomography (OCT) to visualize the 
        arteries and identify areas of narrowing. Such methods provide valuable information about the anatomy of the arteries,
        but they do not provide direct information about the functional significance of the CAS. Functional assessment of 
        CAS typically involves measuring the fractional flow reserve (FFR), which is the ratio of the blood pressure 
        downstream of the stenosis to the blood pressure upstream of the stenosis during maximum blood flow.
        However, measuring FFR requires the use of a pressure wire, which can be invasive and carries some risks.
        Therefore, there is a need for non-invasive methods to assess the functional significance of CAS.
