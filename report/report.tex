    \section{Introduction}
        \label{sec:intro}
        Hemodynamics studies the kinematics of blood. Our interest is the kinematic motion
        of blood within the human macrocirculatory system, i.e. the flow of blood in large
        vessels such as arteries and veins. Blood is observed as a complex fluid of formed
        elements suspended in plasma, thus, the rheological behavior of blood is non-trivial.
        We report techniques and methodologies for modeling blood's motion in large vessels.

        \medskip

        Our report is organized as follows.

        \medskip

        After stating our report's motivation, Sec.~\ref{subsec:physiology} provides a brief
        physiological review of the human circulatory system. Then
        Sec.~\ref{subsec:continuum} reviews the continuum hypothesis, a necessary postulate
        in fluid mechanics which treats blood as a continuous medium. This framing reduces
        the hemodynamic problem to describing blood’s motion in a continuum. Then
        Sec.~\ref{subsec:bloodmodel} discusses rheological assumptions that lead to
        constitutive relations between the material properties of blood. By conservation,
        the kinematic-viscosity Navier–Stokes (NS) equations are obtained  (Sec.~\ref{subsec:ns}).
        The NS equations are a system of coupled system of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs),
        the foundation of our hemodynamic models.

        \medskip

        \paragraph{Motivation}

        \medskip

        The World Health Organization (WHO) claims cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) resulted in
        $\approx \, 32 \%$ of all deaths in $2022$, the leading cause of death globally,
        where $\approx \, 85 \%$ of the deaths where from heart attack or stroke.
        \href{https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cardiovascular-diseases-(cvds)}
        In such cases the underlying CVD is often coronary artery stonosis (CAS), the narrowing
        of a coranary vessel due to the buildup of plaque. Such plaque is r.t. as a stenotic blockage.
        There's a need for evidience-based tools to predict and assess the severity of SBs, as often
        predicition of CAS doesn't mean an obstruction [\cite{ehab332}] and severity assesments often
        use a simple 0D-lummped-parameter model. Cariological interventionists
        need better tools for predicting and treating CAS.

        \medskip

        Current clinical methods for assessing the severity of a SB rely on imaging techniques
        such as angiography, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), and optical coherence tomography (OCT) to visualize the
        arteries and identify areas of narrowing. Such methods provide valuable information about the anatomy of the arteries,
        but they do not provide direct information about the functional significance of the CAS. Functional assessment of
        CAS typically involves measuring the fractional flow reserve (FFR), which is the ratio of the blood pressure
        downstream of the stenosis to the blood pressure upstream of the stenosis during maximum blood flow.
        However, measuring FFR requires the use of a pressure wire, which can be invasive and carries some risks.
        Therefore, there is a need for non-invasive methods to assess the functional significance of CAS.\todo{cleanup, add refs}
