    \section{Introduction}
        \label{sec:intro}
        Hemodynamics studies the kinematics of blood. Our interest is the kinematic motion
        of blood within the Human macrocirculatory system, i.e. the flow of blood in large
        vessels such as arteries and veins. Blood is observed as a complex fluid of formed elements
        suspended in plasma, thus, the rheological behavior of blood is non-trivial. We report techniques
        and methodologies for modeling bloods' motion in the Human macrocirculatory system.

        \medskip

        After stating the motivation of our study, Sec.~\ref{subsec:pysiology} provides a physiological review of a Human's circulatory system in
        Sec.~\ref{subsec:continuum} states the continuum hypothesis, a necessary posulate of
        fluid mechanics. We adopt the continuum hypothesis and treat blood as a continuous medium, then our hemodynamics
        problem simplifies describing the motion of a continous media. In Sec.~\ref{subsec:bloodmodel}, we discuss assumptions
        one may impose on the material-rheological properties of blood. By adopting a particular rheological model, we obtain the necessary constitutive
        relations for a mathematical description of bloods motion. Treating blood as a simple fluid (single-contitute, homogenous, and isotropic
        mixture) yeilds a Newtonian rheological model of blood (i.m.b. justified such models are valid in large vessels, e.g.
        arteries and veins, where the shear rates are sufficiently high) %[\cite{fung1997biomechanics}, Ch.~2]).
        Assuming the density of a material element of blood remains constant as it flows within the vessel, is
        r.t. the incompressibility condition. Together, these assumptions result in an incompressible-newtonian rheological model of blood.
        Finally, in Sec.~\ref{subsec:ns} the Navier-Stokes (NS) system of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) governing
        the motion of an incompressible-newtonian continuum of blood are derived. The NS equations serve
        as the foundation for all subsequent modeling techniques reported herein.

        \medskip

        \paragraph{Motivation}
        Coronary artery stenosis (CAS) is the narrowing of the coronary arteries due
        to the buildup of plaque. Such narrowing can restrict blood flow to the heart muscle,
        which may lead to various cardiovascular problems. Current methods for predicting a stenotic
        blockage (SB) in a coronary artery are rudimentary, and often SB predicition doesn't mean obstruction [\cite{ehab332}].
        Additionally, current clinical methods for assessing the severity of a SB rely on imaging techniques
        such as angiography, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), and optical coherence tomography (OCT) to visualize the 
        arteries and identify areas of narrowing. Such methods provide valuable information about the anatomy of the arteries, but they do not
        provide direct information about the functional significance of the CAS. Functional assessment of CAS typically involves measuring the fractional flow reserve (FFR),
        which is the ratio of the blood pressure downstream of the stenosis to the blood pressure upstream of the stenosis during maximum blood flow.
        However, measuring FFR requires the use of a pressure wire, which can be invasive and carries some risks.
        Therefore, there is a need for non-invasive methods to assess the functional significance of CAS.
